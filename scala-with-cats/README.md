# Introduction
code and material produced whilst studying functional programming principles using Scala and Haskell and in particular, the Scala 
[CATS library](https://books.underscore.io/scala-with-cats/scala-with-cats.html) 
and the 
paper [Monads for functional programming](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/marktoberdorf/baastad.pdf)

The `scala-with-cats` directory contains the code and exercise answers created when studying the typesafe CATS library.
Many of the exercise answers also have corresponding tests either using [Scala Check](https://www.scalacheck.org/) or 
[Scala test](https://www.scalatest.org/).
