# Functional Programming in Scala 

## Introduction

Notes, exercises and snippets created whilst studying [Functional Programming in Scala][bookref] (also known as the 'Red Book') 

## Note

- Some of the exercises in Chapter 3 have also been written in [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) (Lisp variant) and these files have a `.rkt` extension.
- Exercises from Chapter 3 onwards use sbt as the build tool and have corresponding tests.
- Not all exercises in Chapter 7 have been completed.

## Progress as of 03/09/2018 on Functional Programming in Scala

- Skipped Chapter 8 and 9.
- Chapter 10 has been started but not complete.
