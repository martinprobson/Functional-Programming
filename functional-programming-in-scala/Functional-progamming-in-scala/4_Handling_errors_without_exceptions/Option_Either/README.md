Option and Either classes
========================

# Introduction

Option and Either class implementations and exercises taken Chapter 4 of Functinal Programming in Scala

# Details

The `build.sbt` contains the sbt build file. Use `sbt test` to test the code.


## Note

I struggled with some of the concepts in this chapter, so the code has some trace logic included for pedagogical purposes.
Can be swtiched off by changing logging level in [log4j.properties](./Chap_4/Option_Either/src/main/resources/log4j.properties) file.
