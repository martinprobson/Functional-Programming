# Playing with the Scalaz State Monad

The following code was written to help me understand the State Monad as described in Chapter 6 of the FP in Scala book. The best explanation of this I have found is [here](https://softwarecorner.wordpress.com/2013/08/29/scalaz-state-monad/).

`TrafficLights.scala` contains a great example of how to use the State monad by [Timothy Perrett](http://timperrett.com/2013/11/25/understanding-state-monad/)
